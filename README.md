# Tasky

A simple CLI to manage tasks stored in a SQLite database.

## Why Another Task Manager?

I just like writing Go and wanted to learn how to use SQLite ğŸ˜­

## Features

- Add new tasks with descriptions and due dates.
- List all existing tasks with their statuses.
- Update the status of existing tasks (e.g., mark as complete).
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Use SQLite for reliable data storage.
